A friend asked me about running nutrition. He was specifically looking for how distance runners handle nutrition during training. I decided to round up some quick information on available options. I may come back and revisit this post at a later date to flesh out more information on specific products.

When I'm on a long, non-race training run I try to go without any sort of nutrition. However, I know a lot of runners who run with gels or gus of some fashion. I'm not overly familiar with the world of gels, so I did a little research to find out what the available options are. Runner's World has a [pretty thorough rundown](http://www.runnersworld.com/fuel-school/energy-gels-101) of different gel options. Energy replacement or sports drinks are another option that I know a lot of people use. [Tailwind](http://www.tailwindnutrition.com/) is a popular option ([here's a review](http://trailandultrarunning.com/gear-review-tailwind-nutrition/)) that is supposed to contain everything the body needs for all day activities. I know a number of runners who drink [Heed](https://www.hammernutrition.com.au/product/heed/) when training and racing, but I personally think it tastes like crap. I do know, however, that it doesn't mess with my gut the same way Gatorade does.

For some more general nutrition information, Outside Online has a [great writeup](https://www.outsideonline.com/2067571/10-best-pre-run-foods) on some pre-run nutrition options. They also have an [ultramarathon nutrition plan](https://www.outsideonline.com/1869966/ultimate-ultramarathon-nutrition-plan) that covers nutrition before, during, and after a race.
