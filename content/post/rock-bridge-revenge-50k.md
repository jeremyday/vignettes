I had a pretty frustrating weekend. On Friday I was carrying a couple of heavy boxes of books into the house and smashed my knee into the doorway. And by smashed I mean I bruised the top of my right knee cap. It hurt like shit for a while Friday night but then calmed down. I didn't think much of it until Saturday morning.

On Saturday I went down to Columbia to run the [Rock Bridge Revenge 50k](http://columbiatrackclub.com/results/rockbridge/index.html). I got to Rock Bridge State Park plenty early, got signed in, and ready to go. The trails at Rock Bridge State Park were a lot of fun, with a great mix of technical, some hills, and some very runnable stuff. My legs and lungs felt great, but at around mile 12 I started feeling my right knee. It slowly heat up until near the end of the first loop when it started sending lancing pain up my leg. I ran the first loop, 16 miles by my watch, in just a hair under three hours, and figure I probably could have finished the race in around 6:15. However, with Oscar being super mobile I didn't want to be incapacitated by a swollen knee, so I decided to can the race after the first loop. Even with a DNF I felt it was a great, strong 16 mile training run.

Sunday morning I was up early. Like every morning I took Horace and Ginger for a walk around the block, which is usually around 0.6 miles. By the last quarter mile my right knee was talking loudly. I was pissed, but I did the smart thing and canned the [F.L.A.T.S. Half Marathon](http://www.active.com/kirksville-mo/running/trail-run-races/6th-annual-flats-trail-half-marathon-2016?int) I was going to run later in the morning. I was really looking forward to getting some quality miles on the local trails and supporting the excellent local running community. Sadly it wasn't to be.

So I ended up having to bail on two races because a stupid, non-running-related injury. Not a good weekend.
