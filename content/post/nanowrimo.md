November is [National Novel Writing Month](http://nanowrimo.org/). I've been meaning to participate for, literally, years, but just never find the time. Will I participate this year? I'm still uncertain. Guess I'll find out tomorrow. I have a couple of loose story ideas kicking around I could work on. NaNoWriMo is not about polish, it's just about getting words on the page, which is something I very much need to work on. More words, and more importantly more words consistently, is key to better writing, I think.

There are a ton of events and things going on _around_ NaNoWriMo, such as kickoff events, check ins, writing partners, and conversations. But who has time for that when you need to write a bunch every day?
