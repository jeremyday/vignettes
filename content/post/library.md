title: Great Library of Spire
---
The Great Library of Spire started out modestly enough as a house overflowing with books. The Librarian spent her days traveling around Spire saving books and pieces of obscure knowledge from being lost to the dust of ages. Over the years bookshelves grew more and more crowded and new shelves were added halfhazardly as they became available. When her small home grew too crowded to navigate the Librarian bought the adjacent houses and started moving books into them.

An innocuous change.

Yet another change.
