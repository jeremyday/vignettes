On Saturday I ran the [IMTUF 100](http://imtuf100.com/). Unfortunately I missed a cutoff at mile 80 and DNFed. After 80 miles and probably 17,000 or so feet of climbing my climbing legs just blew up and I couldn't keep anything resembling a decent pace on the climbs. My descending legs were working just fine. I executed everything in this race perfectly; nutrition was spot on, hydration was never an issue, and I was running smartly. However, I just didn't have the strength in my legs to keep hiking the mountains. Strength training was one of the things I gave up as I prepared for my move this summer, and that ended up really hurting my late-race performance. I also could have run a few more miles during training, but I was pretty happy with the volume I was building up to.

I'm not going to give a play-by-play account of the race itself, but I'll hit some high points.
