title: Moab 200 Race Preparation
---

I'm seriously considering running the [Moab 200](http://www.grandslam200.com/moab-200.html) next June/July. That being the case, it is not too early to start considering the races I want to run in preparation. Here are some of the races I'm _thinking_ about running between now and a possible Moab 200.

## 2016.12.10 - [The Hitchcock Experience 100](http://www.irunwithgoats.org/hitchcock-hundred.html/)

This race is outside of Council Bluffs, Iowa. In December the weather can be pretty brutal and cold. That's what appeals to me about this race; I've never dealt with temperatures potentially in the teens and lower for extended periods of time. For instance, on [December 10, 2012](https://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KCBF/2012/12/10/DailyHistory.html?req_city=Underwood&req_state=IA&req_statename=&reqdb.zip=51576&reqdb.magic=1&reqdb.wmo=99999) the max temparature at the nearest weather station was 26 and the min was 5, with an average of 16 degrees. I've never run in anything remotely that cold, and the challenge sounds really fantastic. The race has eight loops, which does not sound at all fun, but each loop is brutally hilly; the overall elevation gain is just a hair north of 19,000 feet. This should be a fun experience.

## 2017.01.07 - [Bandera 100k](http://www.tejastrails.com/bandera/)

I am _really_ looking forward to this race. I have four finishes at Bandera and with one more I'll collect my 500k jacket. I wasn't able to go in 2015 because my son was all of thee weeks old, and this year I had bronchitis. My return to the race is long overdue. It's always a great experience and I'm looking forward to seeing a bunch of friends down there.

## 2017.01.14 - [Ouachita Switchbacks 50k](https://www.facebook.com/events/1441951025820352/)

I've never run this race before but I know a bunch of people that run it every year and really love it. The pictures look amazing, so I'd really like to make it.

## 2017.02.24 - [LOViT 100](http://www.runlovit.com/)

I ran the inaugural LOViT 100k a few years ago and the inaugural 100 miler the following year. It's a good time of year to be in the mountains outside of Hot Springs, so I may be back this coming February.

## 2017.03.04 - [Tinajas 100k](http://www.tejastrails.com/tinajas/)

This race sounds extremely interesting. Like [Cactus Rose](http://www.tejastrails.com/cactus-rose/), the aid stations are not manned and they contain only water, ice, and shelter. The terrain looks suitably rugged for a race building up to Moab 200. I suspect I could plan the aid station so I have serious aid every 10-20 miles, much like the aid at Moab, while never really being far from help if necessary.

## 2017.03.17 - 2017.03.19 [3 Days of Syllamo](http://www.syllamo.org/3days/)

3 Days of Syllamo is a 50k one day, a 50 miler the next day, and a 20k the last day. I've run it a couple of times and it's always a great event. It might make for some great gear testing and good practice running on tired legs. A bonus is that I know a ton of people that go every year, so it would be fun to hang out with folks I don't see very often.

## 2017.04.29 - [Pandora's Box of Rox 52.4](http://www.tejastrails.com/pandora/)

I ran Pandora's Box of Rox Marathon a few years ago and really enjoyed it. It gets very hot on the giant granite dome, so the training might be spot on for Moab 200.

## 2017.04.29 - [Flatrock 101k](http://www.flatrock101.com/)

This race has a couple of advantages over Pandora's Box of Rox. First, it's much closer to where I live, so travel would be greatly simplified. It's also longer, and from what I hear the terrain is brutally technical, making it right up my alley. However, I don't think it gets as hot as Box of Rox. I'll have to decide whether heat or distance and technicality are what I'm looking for, but I suspect distance and technicality will win.

## 2017.05.27 - [Booneville Backroads Ultra 100](http://boonevillebackroadsultra.com/)

I don't know much about this race, but it's only about three hours from my house and might be a good tune-up.
