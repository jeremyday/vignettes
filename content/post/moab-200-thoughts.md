When I finished running [Bigfoot 200](http://www.bigfoot200.com/) back in August 2014 it took me a long time to mentally get back into trail running. It was a hugely rewarding experience, but it drained everything I had, both physically and mentally. Now, more than two years later, I'm starting to come back around to the idea of doing another 200 miler. The [Tahoe 200](http://www.tahoe200.com/) started sounding interesting a few months ago, but it was the information coming out about the [Moab 200](http://www.grandslam200.com/moab-200.html) that really started catching and holding my attention.

There are a number of things that really sound appealing about Moab 200. First, the mountains [look truly amazing](https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=moab&go=&form=QBIL&qs=n). Bigfoot 200 had lots of forest, rugged mountains, and a lot of climbing. I loved the mountains out there, but there's something that really speaks to me about the barren desert terrain at Moab. Moab does have almost half as much climbing as Bigfoot, which kind of sucks, but it is a higher-elevation race and tops out about 11,000 feet, which is really stout. It also has heat that Bigfoot did not have. The coup de gr√¢ce, though, is that Moab is actually almost 230 miles! That's some fucking crazy distance and really speaks to my inner masochist.
