  <td>2017.01.17</td><td>3.5</td><td>0:59:56</td><td>2772</td><td>Tough climb today. I'm wondering if the treadmill I was on is actually going a little steeper than the others. In any case, I didn't think I would make it and I just barely did.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2017.01.18</td><td>3.5</td><td>0:59:26</td><td>2772</td><td>Easier than yesterday. I was going to go for a run right after the climb but I needed to go home and answer some of Vasilina's work questions.</td>

  <td>2017.01.21</td><td>13.21</td><td>2:02:26</td><td>306</td><td>I ran three miles and then met Royce for a 10 mile out-and-back along a sometimes very sloppy Patterson. It was a beautiful morning for a run, and the company was excellent.</td>

<tr>
  <td>2017.01.23</td><td>3.6</td><td>0:59:58</td><td>2851.2</td><td>Solid hike today. This was my first time doing a full hour at 3.6 miles per hour, and it felt pretty good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2017.01.24</td><td>3.6</td><td>0:59:55</td><td>2851.2</td><td>The middle third or so was pretty rough. I tried taking my Kindle and reading and that worked out pretty well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2017.01.25</td><td>3.6</td><td>0:59:55</td><td>2851.2</td><td>Better climbing today than yesterday. I got into a solid groove with the story I'm reading on my Kindle and time seemed to go pretty quickly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2017.01.26</td><td>3.6</td><td>0:59:54</td><td>2851.2</td><td>I needed to blow off some steam, and this hike did the trick. Everything went great.</td>

<tr>
  <td>2017.01.27</td><td>1.8</td><td>0:29:54</td><td>1425.6</td><td>Hike today was just okay. I decided to cut it short in order to rest a little for my run tomorrow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2017.01.28</td><td>10.06</td><td>1:28:12</td><td>290.0</td><td>I met Royce and Alex, whom I had never met, and we were going to run on the trails. However, Royce fell in the first tenth of a mile and the trails were pretty sloppy, so we ended up with a nice road run instead. We went a bit faster than we did last weekend, and it was very windy.</td>
</tr>

  <td>2017.01.29</td><td>8.01</td><td>1:08:05</td><td>110.0</td><td>I don't know what got into us, but I ran with Royce, Mark, and Alex and we went way faster than we probably needed to. It felt great, though.</td>

  <td>2017.02.01</td><td>3.7</td><td>0:59:48</td><td>2930.4</td><td>This was a total ass-kicker. My legs and lungs really didn't feel like cooperating, and I had to play a bunch of mind games to keep going past the first 15 minutes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2017.02.02</td><td>3.7</td><td>0:59:53</td><td>2930.4</td><td>Easier than yesterday. I managed to get into a good groove, and the ebook I'm reading, Halfway Home, is pretty interesting so far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2017.02.04</td><td>13.52</td><td>2:2:11</td><td>280.0</td><td>Excellent cold run with Royce. We went down First Trail to Highway 11 and then over to Highway 3. First time I've been that far south of town, and it was a lot of fun.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2017.02.05</td><td>8.58</td><td>1:15:11</td><td>216.0</td><td>Excellent run with Royce. He showed me most of the old Kirksville Marathon course, and it made for a very pleasant cap to the weekend.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2017.02.10</td><td>3.7</td><td>0:59:53</td><td>2930.4</td><td>Again, the first five minutes were tough and then things got better. I seriously considered stopping at half an hour, to save something for tomorrow, but I need the climbing, so I kept going.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2017.02.11</td><td>15.04</td><td>2:11:18</td><td>281.0</td><td>Longest training run in a long time. I met Royce, Ted, Tony, and Janet and we went north on Industrial. I had never run up that way, and it was a very fun change of pace. I went stupid fast, though, and ran the 12 miles at the end at an 8:37 pace!</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2017.02.12</td><td>5.21</td><td>0:45:50</td><td>85.0</td><td>Easy run zig-zagging around town to give my legs a bit of a rest. They are toast from yesterday.</td>

  <td>2017.02.15</td><td>3.8</td><td>0:59:43</td><td>3009.6</td><td>The break really helped, as my legs felt great on this hike. This was my first hike of more than 3,000 feet in an hour, and it felt amazing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2017.02.17</td><td>5.31</td><td>0:45:47</td><td>564.0</td><td>Well, this run started out very easy, but the gorgeous weather got the best of me and I ended up going a good deal faster than expected. It was also much hillier than I anticipated, which is not a bad thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2017.02.18</td><td>3.06</td><td>0:29:59</td><td>98.0</td><td>Started my run with a sluggish three miles. Couldn't get my legs or brain engaged.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2017.02.18</td><td>13.11</td><td>1:59:21</td><td>386.0</td><td>I picked up Royce and we ran a solid 12 miles together. We head south of town and picked up a ridge trail no some conservation land before hooking up with the Thousand Hills State Park trail and coming out at the Rainbow Basin trailhead. The last four miles were pretty zippy. My legs were tired by the end, but on the whole they held up well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2017.02.19</td><td>4.01</td><td>0:35:09</td><td>105.0</td><td>The combination of large brunch and chips and salsa made this run suck, bad.-s</td>

<tr>
  <td>2017.02.21</td><td>3.8</td><td>0:59:43</td><td>3009.6</td><td>This workout might get easier, eventually. I really struggled for the first half hour before I was able to convince my legs to give the workout a shot.</td>
</tr>
