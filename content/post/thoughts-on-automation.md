title: Thoughts on Automation
---

When I first started looking at home automation I was just looking into smart lighting options. However, the more I look into some of the available options (my research has been far from exhaustive) the more I'm seeing that automation above and beyond lighting is not only possible but easy and effective.

I'm still thinking I might start with something like the [Hue Starter Kit](http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/productdetail/philips-hue-white-and-color-ambiance-starter-kit-a19). Once I get a handle on that I could easily expand to a [SmartThings Home Monitoring Kit](https://shop.smartthings.com/#!/kits/samsung-smartthings-home-monitoring-kit). Seems like the systems can work together well enough, and I really enjoy the idea of [various](https://ifttt.com/hue) [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/smartthings) integrations. Also, as I mentioned in [Smart Lighting Notes](/vignettes/smart-lighting-notes), SmartThings has what looks like a very interesting [arrival sensor](https://shop.smartthings.com/#!/products/samsung-smartthings-arrival-sensor) that can trigger actions whenever it comes within range of the [hub](https://shop.smartthings.com/#!/products/samsung-smartthings-hub). For instance, when I come in the front door (or just approach the front door) the lights in my house can turn on. There is also a [multi-purpose sensor](https://www.smartthings.com/works-with-smartthings/sensors/samsung-smartthings-multipurpose-sensor) that goes on doors or windows. I rather like the idea that I could mount the sensor on my toddler's door and get notified whenever he opens, or tries to open, the door in the middle of the night.

I'm not sure if there's any way for me to automatically turn my [Sonos](https://www.sonos.com/en-us/home) on, but it's something that bears experimentation.

In addition to active automation, such as turning lights or music on when things happen, it looks like the SmartThings system has useful integrations with a [smoke detector](https://www.smartthings.com/works-with-smartthings/smoke-detectors-and-alarms/first-alert-smoke-detector-zsmoke) and [carbon monoxide detector](https://www.smartthings.com/works-with-smartthings/smoke-detectors-and-alarms/first-alert-smoke-detector-and-carbon-monoxide-alarm-zcombo) that can send you notifications to your phone or tablet whenever they detect smoke or carbon monoxide. It also integrates with [deadbolts](https://www.smartthings.com/works-with-smartthings/locks/yale-push-button-deadbolt-yrd210), which you can lock or unlock from anywhere using your phone or tablet. Those are very worthwhile from a peace of mind perspective.
