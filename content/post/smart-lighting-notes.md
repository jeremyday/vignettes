title: Smart Lighting Notes
---

I have recently started getting interested in the idea of adding some smart lighting to my house. However, I don't know anything about smart lighting yet. To rectify that I've started researching some smart lighting solutions. This has dovetailed a bit into more general smart home research, but my main emphasis for now is on lighting.

# [Philips Hue](http://www2.meethue.com/en-us/products/)

Philips Hue seems to be the one of the best available smart lighting options. The problem is that Hue is _only_ lighting, so there's no upgrade path to other smart home solutions.

# [WeMo Home Automation](http://www.belkin.com/us/Products/c/home-automation/)

Belkin's WeMo line of home automation products span much more than just lighting; there are web cameras, smart plugs, lights, and motion detectors.

# [SmartThings Lighting](https://www.smartthings.com/uses/lighting-energy)

SmartThings does not have its own lighting. Rather, it can host a bunch of lights from other services, including the Philips Hue. Additionally, SmartThings has a variety of really useful sensors, such as a motion sensor, a magnet-powered door or window sensor, and a presence sensor. The presence sensor sounds particularly interesting, because I can absolutely imagine automatically turning on lights when I come home at night.

## Notes/Reviews

1. [Cnet SmartThings Review](https://www.cnet.com/products/smartthings-know-and-control-your-home-kit/review/) - An old review, but I think most of the information is still accurate.
1. [PC Mag SmartThings Hub Review](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2456422,00.asp)
1. [Cnet SmartThings (Second Generation) Review](https://www.cnet.com/products/smartthings-hub-and-sensors/) - The second generation SmartThings hub sounds pretty useful, but it sounds like SmartThings has had some [serious glitch issues](https://www.cnet.com/news/samsungs-smartthings-smart-home-push-hits-disconnect/) over recent months. I need to find out if these issues have been resolved.
