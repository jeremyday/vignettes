title: Smart Lighting Notes
---

I have recently started getting interested in the idea of adding some smart lighting to my house. However, I don't know anything about smart lighting yet. To rectify that I've started researching some smart lighting solutions. This has dovetailed a bit into more general smart home research, but my main emphasis for now is on lighting.

Philips Hue seems to be the one of the best available smart lighting options. The problem is that Hue is _only_ lighting, so there's no upgrade path to other smart home solutions.

Belkin's WeMo line of home automation products span much more than just lighting; there are web cameras, smart plugs, lights, and motion detectors.
